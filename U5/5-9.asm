; Recursive Procedure   (5-9.asm)
; Program Description: Direct recursion is the term we use when a procedure calls itself. Of course, you never want to let a procedure keep calling itself forever,
;                      because the runtime stack would fill up. Instead, you must limit the recursion in some way.
;                      Write a program that calls a recursive procedure. Inside this procedure, add 1 to a counter so you can verify the number of times it executes.
;                      Run your program with a debugger, and at the end of the program, check the counterâ€™s value.
;                      Put a number in ECX that specifies the number of times you want to allow the recursion to continue.
;                      Using only the LOOP instruction (and no other conditional statements from later chapters), find a way for the recursive procedure to call itself a fixed number of times.
